# OhioHealthKata
A small console app that allows a baby sitter to input the times they worked for a night and calculate how much to charge the client.
What youâ€™ll need :
  text editor or IDE
  JDK 6 or later
  Install Gradle




This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward:

The babysitter

starts no earlier than 5:00PM
leaves no later than 4:00AM
gets paid $12/hour from start-time to bedtime
gets paid $8/hour from bedtime to midnight
gets paid $16/hour from midnight to end of job
gets paid for full hours (no fractional hours)
Feature: As a babysitter In order to get paid for 1 night of work I want to calculate my nightly charge

Some constraints and observations on our inputs:
The start time must be before 4am.
The end time must be after the start time.
The bedtime must not be before the start time.
The bedtime must not be after the end time.
The bedtime can be the same as either the start or end time.
The inputs are in the form of times of the day and are constrained by the kata to be from 5pm to 4am, excluding partial hours. Therefore there are a total of 12 possible values that can be used as inputs (ignoring the constraints mentioned in the previouse bullet points).
To make the calculations easier, we can make a method to covert the times to integers (e.g. 5pm becomes 17, 4am becomes 28) Extending past 24 to keep calculation easier.
Basic walkthrough of what our solution will do
It will take three inputs:
The start time.
The end time.
The bedtime.
It will convert them to the 17-28 integer scale.
It will validate the converted inputs to check whether they violate constraints (i.e. it will check that the inputs "make sense" with respect to one another).
It will used the converted inputs to calculate the amount of hours worked during each sub-shift in order of precedence of the pay rates:
Late Hour shift.
Bedtime shift.
Normal Hour shift.
It will multiply each sub-shift by its pay rate then add those sub-totals and return the total pay amount.
